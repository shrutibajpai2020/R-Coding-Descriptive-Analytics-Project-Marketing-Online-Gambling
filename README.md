# R-Coding-Descriptive-Analytics-Project-Marketing-Online-Gambling
Goal of the project was to provide a markdown file that evaluated the customers and their virtual betting behaviors to segment the most appropriate customers to target. Created an RFM analysis as well as utilized Cocal for collaboration based work. Utilized packages such as tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2 for manipulating and visualizing data. This codebook provides information for both the raw and analytic datasets used to generate the first epidemiological report of actual Internet sports betting (LaBrie et al., 2007). These datasets come from the collaborative Internet gambling research project between the Division on Addictions (DOA) and bwin Interactive Entertainment, AG (bwin), an Internet betting service provider headquartered in Vienna, Austria. These datasets provide evidence from the first eight months of the first prospective longitudinal, real-time, Internet sports betting behavior study that took place from February 1, 2005 through September 30, 2005. The analytic dataset contains information representing eight months of aggregated betting behavior data for 40,499 sequential bwin Internet sports subscribers who opened an account with bwin during the period from February 1, 2005 through February 27, 2005.
